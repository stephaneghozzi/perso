I am an independent data scientist and consultant based in Berlin, Germany. A physics graduate, with PhD, of the École normale supérieure, I have worked as a mathematical modeller, coder and developer in fundamental and applied research. My main domains of expertise are physics, infectious-disease surveillance and epidemiology. Experimental biology and visual arts have also been part of my professional life. 

This lead me to live and work in five cities in four countries, and speak three languages fluently. I use the pronouns he/him.

I love that data science is a transversal discipline, that allows one to work on diverse topics and collaborate with people from all walks of life.
