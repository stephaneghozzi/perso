# StÃ©phane Ghozzi's personal page: source code

The source-code files for [https://stephaneghozzi.com](https://stephaneghozzi.com) (which is an alias for stephaneghozzi.github.io).

The files of the website are generated via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and can be found at [https://github.com/stephaneghozzi/stephaneghozzi.github.io](https://github.com/stephaneghozzi/stephaneghozzi.github.io). 

After installing Hugo and downloading this repository, run `> hugo` in this directory. The website files are generated in `public/` and can be copied at the root of the website. Note that you need to set the proper base URL in [config.toml](config.toml)

The styling and responsive layout are based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). The font used is Google Fonts' [Chivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chivo).

N.B.: the Twitter card is not automatically generated. Rather, the idea is to generate a the twitter-card page and then take screenshot. To generate this page build or preview the website including drafts (run `> hugo -D` or `> hugo server -D`).
